# Final Fantasy Notes

This project is a website displaying cards with informations about Final Fantasy characters, games, and creatures. You can view it at [www.ffnotes.com](http://ffnotes.com)

It has been developped with react and with the fantastic [Moogle API](https://github.com/jackfperryjr/mog#readme) created by Jack Perry Jr.
This is one of my first project with React so it was meant mainly for me to learn the basics.


## Navigation

You will find 3 main sections, characters, games and creatures. The last one is an about page with contact form. 
On the first page, you can select characters from a specific game with the horizontal scroll menu. I didn't use this menu in the other two sections as there is a small amount of data for now.

## Technologies

The technologies I used among others include Sass, react-icons, Helmet for better SEO and emailjs to receive contact messages directly to my email address. 

I also used some React packages like React-router-dom for routing, react-hook-form for the contact form and Jest and react-testing-library for testing.
